"""
Retrieval interface consumed by the chat service.

Embeds the query, pulls top-k from Chroma, returns a list of dicts
{source, score, text}. If the collection is empty or embeddings fail we
return [] — callers treat that as "no retrieval, answer anyway".

Relevance thresholds:
  - MIN_FILTER_RELEVANCE: if the city-filtered best match is weaker than
    this, we assume the user's question isn't actually about the hint city
    and fall back to unfiltered semantic search.
  - MIN_RESULT_RELEVANCE: final chunks with score below this are dropped
    from the returned list so the Sources UI doesn't show noise.
